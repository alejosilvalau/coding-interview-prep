# Design The Uber API
## Gathering API Requirements
The API Design will be based on the **core ride-hailing** service of Uber. This means:
1. Passengers booking a ride from their phone
2. They are matched with a driver
3. During the ride, they can track the driver's location
    - This happens up until the drive finishes or gets cancelled
    - They can also see the price of the ride and the estimated time to location, amongst other things.

The **core ride-hailing** service has a passenger-facing side and a driver-facing side. This design involves both.

## Coming Up With A Plan
The API will be centered around a **Ride** entity. This entity will be associated to every Uber ride and will contain information about the ride. This includes information about the passenger and the driver.

Because an Uber ride can only have one passenger and one driver, all the **permissioning related** to ride operations are going to be handled through the passenger and driver IDs.

Operations like **GetRide** or **EditRide** will be based entirely on **userId**. Which will then return the appropriate ride tied to that passenger or driver.

## Entities
**Ride**
It has a unique Id, information about the passenger and the driver, a status, and more details about the ride. This is the resulting schema:
- rideId: string,
- passengerInfo: PassengerInfo
- driverInfo?: DriverInfo
- rideStatus: RideStatus
- start: GeoLocation

**PassengerInfo**
- id: string
- name: string
- rating: int

**DriverInfo**
- id: string
- name: string
- rating: int
- ridesCount: int
- vehicleInfo: VehicleInfo

**VehicleInfo**
- licensePlate: string
- description: string
- capacity: int

**RideStatus**
- enum (CREATED, MATCHED, STARTED, FINISHED, CANCELLED)

## Passenger API
The passenger API will consist of simple CRUD operations interacting with the Ride entity. It will also have an endpoint to stream the driver's location alongside a ride.

```
CreateRide(userId: string, pickup: Geolocation, destination: Geolocation) => Ride
```

This endpoint will be called when a passenger asks for a ride. It will create a **Ride** instance with no **DriverInfo** and with the **RideStatus** set to **CREATED**. The backend will then call another method, **FindDriver**, which uses an algorithm to find the most best driver given the location, rating and ridesCount among other parameters.

Once the driver is selected and the driver accepts the drive, the API will call the **EditRide** method and will change the status of the ride to **MATCHED** and it will fill the **DriverInfo** with the new information.

```
GetRide(userId: string) => Ride
```
The endpoint will be called every 1-10 seconds after the ride has been created. And continuous until the status has changed to **MATCHED**.

It will be also pulled during the ride every 20-90 seconds, to update the ride's estimated price and time to destination. Also checking the **RideStatus** if the ride has been cancelled by the driver, between other things.

```
EditRide(userId: string, [...params?: properties of the Ride objet that needs to be edited]) => Ride

CancelRide(userId: string) => void
```
**CancelRide** is a wrapper around **EditRide** which calls **EditRide(userId: string, rideStatus: CANCELLED)**

```
StreamDriverLocation(userId: string)
```
Used to stream the location of the driver continuously through a long-lived websocket connection. The driver is identified through the **Ride** entity which is searched by the **userId**.

## Driver API
The driver API relies on similar CRUD operations used for the passenger API on the Ride entity.
```
SetDriverStatus(userId: string, driverStatus: DriverStatus) => void
```
**DriverStatus**
- enum (UNAVAILABLE, IN_RIDE, IN_RIDE_DONE, STANDBY)

The endpoint is called whenever the driver wants a new ride, or it has finished all the rides that he/she wants to do on that day. When the driver status is set to **STANDBY**, the backend will call an internal **FindRide** method which will trigger an algorithm to enqueue the driver on a queue of drivers waiting for a new ride.

The purpose of the algorithm is to find the best ride possible between the rider and the driver.

Once the ride has been found, the ride gets locked to the rider for 30 seconds. This is a window of time in which the rider can accept or reject the ride. If the rider accepts the ride, the backend will internally call the **EditRide** method with the new driver's info as well as setting the driver status to **MATCHED**.

```
GetRide(userId: string) => Ride
```
It's called every 20-90 seconds alongside the trip to update the estimated price, time to destination, whether it's been canceled, etc.

```
EditRide(userId: string, [...params?: properties of the Ride objet that needs to be edited]) => Ride

AcceptRide(userId: string) => void
```
The API will call EditRide(userId, MATCHED) and SetDriverStatus(userId, IN_RIDE) as stated previously.

```
CancelRide(userId: string) => void
```
This is a wrapper around the **EditRide** method which calls **EditRide(userId, CANCELLED)**

```
PushLocation(userId: string, location: GeoLocation) => void
```
This is continuously called on the driver's phone alongside the ride. It streams the driver's location to the passenger who has opened a web socket to know it's location. The **userId** belongs to the passenger, which is the one associated with the **Ride** entity.

This is the counter part of the **StreamDriverLocation** on the Passenger API. It pushes the location data to that opened Web-Socket connection.

## Uber Pool
Uber Pool rides allow for multiple passengers on different Uber accounts to share an Uber ride for a cheaper price.

To handle this functionality, we will have another entity called **PoolRide** which would have a list of **Rides** attached to it. Each passenger would call the **CreateRide** endpoint when they need a ride. Therefore, each one will have their own **Â¨Ride** entity. 

These different **Ride** entities of all the passengers will be attached to the **PoolRide** entity with additional information about the pool ride.

The entity will also have a **DriverStatus** to allow drivers to limit the amount of passenger, by marking themselves as accepting new passengers or already full.

When a passenger finishes the ride, the **SetDriverStatus** is called and it's status is marked as **IN_RIDE_DONE**. Which means that the driver has already finished one ride, but there are more rides to complete.

The rest of the functionality remains the same.

This is the resulting schema:

**PoolRide**
- driverInfo: DriverStatus
- rides: Ride[]
